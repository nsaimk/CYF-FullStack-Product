# My Full-Stack Project
## Overview
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage their daily diet plans. Users can view a list of meals for each day, add new meals, and navigate between different days to plan their diet efficiently. The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. However, I made this project in order to complete a part of application for CodeYourFuture Product volunteer work. Because of this it shows very basic features.

## Features
- **View Daily Diet Plan:** Users can view a list of meals for each day, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

- **Next and Previous Days:** Users can navigate between different days to plan their diet for the entire week.

## Technologies Used 
- **Frontend:** The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Backend:** The backend of the application is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs to handle user requests.

- **Database:** MongoDB is used as the database to store user meal data.

- **Styling:** CSS and Bootstrap are used for styling the frontend components and creating a visually appealing user interface.

- **Authentication:** User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure the application's endpoints.

- **API Communication:** Axios is used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to interact with the backend APIs.

## Getting Started
To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
https://github.com/nsaimk/CYF-FullStack-Product.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```sh
cd my-full-stack-project
npm install
```
3. Start the backend server:
```sh
npm start
```
4. Start the frontend development server:
```sh
npm start
```
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000/, and you can access it from your web browser.


## Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for future enhancements to improve the application:

- **User Registration and Login:** Implement a user registration and login system to allow users to create accounts and access their personalized diet plans.

- **Meal Categories:** Add the ability to categorize meals into different types (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) for better organization.

- **Meal Images:** Allow users to upload images of their meals to make the diet plan visually appealing.

- **Meal Recommendations:** Provide meal recommendations based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and fitness goals.
